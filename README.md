# many-zip-files
one zip file with 16 zip files in it with 16 zip files in each of the 16 zip files with 16 zip files in the 16 zip files in the each of the 16 zip files and so on 16 times which is when each zip file has one zip file with one zip file zip one zip file with one 16 GiB file of all zeroes<br>
that should be <i>16 GiB * 16 ^ 16</i> which is <i>295,147,905,179,352,825,856</i> unless it's not in which case, i'm bad at math
